            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Like it was said in the video, Version Control is, “One main repository for all of the project files.” This works like a library and allows team members to “check files out,” edit them as they like, “then check them back in.” This help tremendously with file sharing, as it dissolves the problem of multiple students trying to edit a file at the same time. It is also known as revision control or source control, and applies to documents, programs, and other assortments of information. It is a very important factor when working with a team but if working by yourself or with one other associate it may not be that important. .</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This is the system of Version Control and is very intensive at noting the changes. Automatically, it notes who changed the file, when and what they changed in the file and they merge some of the changes to the same file. There are some benefits to Version Control System too such as, you cannot overwrite files, there is a “common repository” that each file is held in allowing people to work simultaneously on the same file without conflict as each team member gets their own file, it allows you to revert back to the original file if you mess up, and it backups the file so you can start fresh if you want. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is someplace where you store things. In this lesson, it is used to store files and directories so “…developers can record their change history and start tracking their status and version.” Developers can track the file from beginning to end and see every change that was made in the file and every edit done to the file. Now there are two versions of repositories, a remote repository, and a local repository. A remote repository is a, “repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members.” This is like a LAN, as it resides on a server that each developer has access too. A local repository resides on a local machine and is only accessible to that user on that local machine.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free open source distributed version control system made to handle small and large projects quickly and efficiently. It allows you to create local branches, you can have multiple workflows, it is a very diverse program when it comes to version control systems. Many big companies use it such as Netflix, Facebook, Google etc. Git allows every user to have a complete copy of the repository data stored locally, which allows it to be accessed and edited at any time locally. There is no failure as you can always go back to the original file and start all over. Finally, Git prevents an unintentional overwrite of a file on a shared repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a command heavy program when it comes to editing your material and we should learn a few of the commands as this program is huge worldwide. ‘git init’ creates a new local repository and is used in the beginning of creating your file. ‘git add’ allows you to add files to your repository and is used a lot throughout your editing. ‘git commit -m’ commits files to the head allowing them to be pushed to other repositories and is huge when transferring files from local to remote repositories. ‘git push origin master’ pushes the files to the master branch of your remote repository. </p>
